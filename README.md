## Objective

The objective of this project is to compare the beer, spirits, and wine data based on their Price, Rating/Rate Count, (R/RC)/Price, and Average ABV/ABV's listed. The comparison will be done for each beverage type separately, and the averages will be calculated for each of the parameters mentioned above.

## Methodology

The comparison will be done for each beverage type separately. For each type, the following parameters will be calculated:

- Average Price: the average price of all the brands in the dataset
- Average Rating: the average rating of all the brands in the dataset
- Average R/RC: the average of the ratio of rating and rate count of all the brands in the dataset
- Average (R/RC)/Price: the average of the ratio of rating and rate count divided by the price of all the brands in the dataset
- Average ABV/ABVâ€™s listed: the average ABV of all the brands in the dataset

## Conclusion

This project will help in identifying the brands of alcoholic beverages that offer the best value for money based on the parameters mentioned above. The results can be used by consumers to make an informed decision while purchasing alcoholic beverages.
