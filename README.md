# Project 1- Group 2 Fin-Tech Analysis

## Overview
This dataset is a collection of beer, spirits, and wine data downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset contains information on the price, rating, rate count, ABV (alcohol by volume), and other details for various brands of alcoholic beverages.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to compare the beer, spirits, and wine data based on their Price, Rating/Rate Count, (R/RC)/Price, and Average ABV/ABV's listed. The comparison will be done for each beverage type separately, and the averages will be calculated for each of the parameters mentioned above.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle and can be accessed through the following link:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/limtis/wikiliq-dataset?select=spirits_data.csv

The dataset contains the following files:

- beer_data.csv: contains information on various brands of beer
- spirits_data.csv: contains information on various brands of spirits
- wine_data.csv: contains information on various brands of wine

## Methodology

The comparison will be done for each beverage type separately. For each type, the following parameters will be calculated:

- Average Price: the average price of all the brands in the dataset
- Average Rating: the average rating of all the brands in the dataset
- Average R/RC: the average of the ratio of rating and rate count of all the brands in the dataset
- Average (R/RC)/Price: the average of the ratio of rating and rate count divided by the price of all the brands in the dataset
- Average ABV/ABVâ€™s listed: the average ABV of all the brands in the dataset

## Conclusion

This project will help in identifying the brands of alcoholic beverages that offer the best value for money based on the parameters mentioned above. The results can be used by consumers to make an informed decision while purchasing alcoholic beverages.
We could further add on more wines, spirits and beers to balance out the figures even more. With more contribution, we could find out how steady our overall figures are and see if we need more contribution for more accurate statistics.
We could base multiple projects on this data like presenting to competitors and comparing overall ratings and prices. Showing them our way of determining value and seeing if they want to adapt. Or we could start to make an app, contribute to an existing one and try to see if they can find value in our work.
