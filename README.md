# Project 1 Fin Tech Bootcamp
Comparing Beer, Spirits, and Wine Data

Description
In this project, we will be comparing beer, spirits, and wine data. We have downloaded the data from Kaggle. The data contains information about price, rating/rate count, (R/RC)/price, average ABV/ABVs listed for each beverage type.

We will break down the data for each beverage type and find the average price, rating, R/RC, (R/RC)/price, and ABV/ABVs listed.

Files
The dataset can be found in the following file:

spirits_data.csv, beer_data.csv and wine_data.csv
Methodology
Load the data into a Python environment.
Separate the data by beverage type (beer, spirits, wine).
For each beverage type:
Calculate the average price.
Calculate the average rating.
Calculate the average R/RC.
Calculate the average (R/RC)/price.
Calculate the average ABV/ABVs listed.
Present the results in a clear and concise manner with graphics 

Conclusion
After analyzing the data for each beverage type, we can draw conclusions about the price, rating, R/RC, (R/RC)/price, and ABV/ABVs listed for each type. We can also compare the results across the different beverage types to see how they differ.
