In this year, founder Don Facundo Bacardi purchased the land in Cuba that would become the distillery that changed the way the world drank rum. By pioneering charcoal filtration and purposeful aging, Bacardi created Bacardi white rum, which set the standard for flavor and balance. However, it wasn't without hardship. The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world's top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.

With its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it's perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean."

Four days earlier on the 2nd February 1952, on the instruction of George Urquhart, two First Fill Sherry Hogsheads - cask numbers 465 and 466 - were filled at Glen Grant and left to quietly mature at the distillery. Cask 465 was transferred to the Bonded Warehouses of Gordon & MacPhail on 26th March 1968. On the 2nd February 2012, exactly sixty years after the whisky was distilled, the instruction was given to carefully empty cask number 465 and bottle the precious contents at cask strength. In honour and celebration of Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee, the Directors at Gordon & MacPhail have released just 85 decanters of Glen Grant 60 Years Old."
