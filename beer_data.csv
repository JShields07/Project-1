A cloudy, sediment-speckled murkiness lingers in the center—a characteristic feature of any Berliner Weisse. With just a slight tilt of the glass towards the face, the beer’s pungent, sour aromas of lemon and Granny Smith apple come forth, but a tinge of sweet, malty wheat curtails the dominant sour smell so as not to prematurely overwhelm the drinker.    The nose doesn’t seem to stray too far for your standard Berliner Weisse, but just after taking the first sip of the Nomader Weisse, one begins to see how Evil Twin’s Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergsø left his nomadic mark on the landscape, or in this case, the Berliner Weisse style. The tangy notes of lemon and apple, just as in the nose, playfully bite at the drinker’s teeth on contact in typical Berliner fashion. However, the Nomader soon reveals Jeppe’s modern day tinkerings with slight hints of white grape, an effect akin to transporting a German Oktoberfest in its entirety right to America: somewhat bizarre, but still delicious."

The aroma is huge and very vinous. A clear impression of oxidized apples is the first thing that hits you, which made us think of heavy old fashioned British apple ciders. The aroma also reveals the wooden notes from the barrels along with some burned toffee and spices like Star anise. It has a very heavy acidic profile at first, one that quickly slides into a smooth kind of sweetness. We taste green apples, carambola and very young green grapes. It has a certain lactic acidic touch and a creamy dry finish that lasts forever and bares the green impressions through. Some mild creamy blue cheese on roasted rye bread would work great due to both the lactic and acidity impressions in this beer."

The Tasting panel Said:   Cloudy light orange with a fine foamy thick white head  Aroma – A mild spicy impression with acidic green apples, cloves and a sweetness as from dried apricots. We also find some bitterness as from lemon peel and a lactic touch. You clearly sense the saison notes as white pepper and mild various spices.  The taste blasts out the saison expressions in the beginning and we think of oxidated apples as you find in certain ciders – after that you get the lactic and sour impression that appears very refreshing and drinkable. A freshness topped with dry impressions of the barrels. You feel like another sip.  The mouth feel is not as carbonated and fizzy as in most of Mikkellers spontan beers. The finish is very dry with a touchy bitterness that again reminds of citric peel. For some this citric bitterness could get too much."
